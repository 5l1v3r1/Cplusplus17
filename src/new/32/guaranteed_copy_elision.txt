/* #31 Guaranteed Copy Elision */
Excerpt adapted from #29 http://bit.ly/Cplusplyus17Ft

C++17 now guarantees copy elision, standardizing a practice by
certain compilers. That is, it “omits copy constructors, resulting in zero-
copy pass-by-value semantics.”[1] Consequently, if an expression
within a call to the dynamic allocator returns a value compatible with
the type invoked by the dynamic allocator (new X (new X())) then only
one call rather than several, are made to the constructor of the type in
question. The net e ect is that less copies of objects are made, which
could otherwise result in expensive operations. This tightens (in the
standard) the behavior of objects when they are copied by value.This is
similar to the behavior under the hood in languages like Java. This,
among other things, have changed and you should read more about
this, here.
