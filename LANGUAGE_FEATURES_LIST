^These are three features grouped into one, which consequently when expanded would make the new feature list count 35.
^^This is implemented in std::byte (<cstddef>) and is not a part of the actual language such as the other primitive data types. It is considered a basic type inasmuch that std::string is considered a basic type.

C++17 also introduced a revision to Elementary string conversions which you can read about here.
